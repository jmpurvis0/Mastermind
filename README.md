# Mastermind
 
A Python-programmed version of the game Mastermind. Players attempt to guess a secret code randomly generated from 6 colors: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and white. After each guess, the game will tell the player which (if any) letters are in the correct or incorrect position. Players have up to 10 attempts to guess the code.
